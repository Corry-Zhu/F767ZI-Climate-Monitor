# Nucleo-F767ZI Climate Monitor

The goal of this project is to modify existing or generate new libraries for various sensors and interface them with the namesake Nuucleo board. The sensors I am currently using are Adafruit breakout boards with libraries intended for Arduino. I am converting such libraries to pure C on top of ST's HAL. If (when) I run into HAL issues or start feeling frisky I may end up getting closer to the hardware.

Ultimately, the contents of this repository will likely be broken out into individual repos for each component library once they are cleaned up. For now, it's just a way to track and publicize progress. As such, I will not take time to write up detailed installation or usage instructions as I'm in the process of developing features.
